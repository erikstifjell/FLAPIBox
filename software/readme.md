# Software
The FLAPIBox uses Bela's IDE for uploading software patches. Although the Bela Mini works with several programming languages, Pure Data has been the prefered language for developing the FLAPIBox. This repository holds diverse modules developed in connection with composing musical pieces. These modules can be joined together to form fully functional patches for the FLAPIBox. The patches for these musical pieces can be found at the repository of the specific pieces, which is linked on this page.
